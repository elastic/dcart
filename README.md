# DCART - Decoupled Components for Automated Ransomware Testing
This project provides a framework for capturing relevant event data from ransomware sample detonations. The captured data may then be analyzed at a later point without the need for further detonations for the given samples. The analysis component will produce a score to indicate the extent of anomalous, ransomware-like behavior observed in the event data.
